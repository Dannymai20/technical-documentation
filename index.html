            <p>JavaScript is an object-oriented scripting language that is cross-platform. It's a small and light language. 
                JavaScript can be connected to the objects of its environment 
                inside a host environment (for example, a web browser) to provide programmatic control over them.</p>
            <p>JavaScript includes a standard library of objects like Array, Date, and Math, as well as a core set of language elements 
                like operators, control structures, and statements.</p>

            <p>This guide assumes you have the following basic background</p>
            <ul>
                <li>A general understanding of the Internet and the World Wide Web</li>
                <li>Good working knowledge of HTML</li>
                <li>Some programming experience</li>

            <header>JavaScript and Java</header>
            <p>JavaScript and Java are similar in some ways but fundamentally different in some others. The JavaScript language resembles Java but does not have Java's static typing and strong type checking. JavaScript follows most Java expression syntax, naming conventions and basic control-flow constructs which was the 
                reason why it was renamed from LiveScript to JavaScript.</p>
            <p>In contrast to Java's compile-time system of classes built by declarations, JavaScript supports a runtime system based on a small number of data types representing numeric, Boolean, and string values. JavaScript has a prototype-based object model instead of the more common class-based object model. The prototype-based model provides dynamic inheritance; that is, what is inherited can vary for individual objects. JavaScript also supports functions without any special declarative requirements. Functions can be 
                properties of objects, executing as loosely typed methods.</p>

        <section class="main-section" id="hello_world">
            <header>Hello World</header>
            <p>To get started with writing JavaScript, open the Scratchpad and write your first "Hello world" JavaScript code:</p>
            <code>
                function greetMe(yourName) { alert("Hello " + yourName); }
                greetMe("World");
            </code>
            <p>Select the code in the pad and hit Ctrl+R to watch it unfold in your browser!</p>
        </section>

        <section class="main-section" id="variables">
            <header>Variables</header>
            <p>You use variables as symbolic names for values in your application. The names of variables, called identifiers, 
                conform to certain rules.
            </p>
            <p>
                A JavaScript identifier must start with a letter, underscore (_), or dollar sign ($); subsequent characters can also be digits (0-9). Because JavaScript is case sensitive, letters include the characters "A" through "Z" (uppercase) and the characters "a" through "z" (lowercase).
            </p>

        <section class="main-section" id="declaring_variables">
            <header>Declaring Variables</header>
            <p>You can declare a vatiable in three different ways:</p>
            <p>
                With the keyword var for example,
                <code>var x = 42;</code>
                This syntex can be used to declare both local and global variables
            </p>
            <p>
                By assigning it a value. For example,
                <code> x = 42;</code>
                This always declares a global variable
            </p>
            <p>With the keyword let. For example
                <code>let y = 13;</code>
                This syntax can be used to devalde a block scope local variable.
            </p>
